        Compiling<br />
        ---------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>Required (and included) libraries:<br />
          libmp3lame      - MP3 encoder           - obs/lame<br />
          libfaac         - AAC encoder           - obs/libfaac<br />
          librtmp         - RTMP protocol         - obs/librtmp<br />
          libsamplerate   - audio resampler       - obs/libsamplerate<br />
          libx264         - x264 encoder          - obs/x264</p>
        <p> To compile OBS and all its sub-libraries, you can use OBS-All.sln<br />
          and compile everything all at once, or you can compile everything<br />
          individually yourself.  x264 and libmp3lame are pre-compiled for<br />
          convenience.<br />
        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
          Windows SDK<br />
          ---------------------------------------------<br />
          It requires the latest windows SDK, as it uses features from<br />
          windows vista, windows 7 and 8.  The windows 8 SDK should also come<br />
          with the latest DirectX includes and libraries<br />
        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
          Compiling LAME (if desired)<br />
          ---------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> I compile lame through the VC makefile.</p>
        <p> Command line:  nmake -f Makefile.MSVC CPU=P3</p>
        <p> Get nasm if you want to compile with assembly, otherwise use ASM=NO<br />
          command line option.  Use MSVCVER=Win64 to compile 64bit.  View<br />
          lame/makefile.msvc for more info.<br />
        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
          Compiling x264 (if desired)<br />
          ---------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> x264 is slightly more troublesome, primarily because it's written in<br />
          C99, yasm, and compile configuration is totally dependent on bash<br />
          scripts.  Usually it's recommended to cross-compile on linux, but I just<br />
          used msys and mingw for windows. There's a guide on how to get x264<br />
          compiled on windows at http://doom10.org/index.php?topic=26.0</p>
        <p> Make sure to use the --enable-win32thread configuration option,<br />
          though I suppose you could make it use posix threads with a bit of work,<br />
          but it's fairly pointless and you'd probably have to add some more stuff<br />
          to the Hacks.cpp file.</p>
        <p>If compiling static (which I don't do anymore), please make sure to<br />
          include the static libgcc.a that your mingw provides.  Depending on your<br />
          mingw version you may need to add/remove stuff from Hacks.cpp to get it<br />
          properly working.  It sucks, I know, but I'm not the one who decided to<br />
          make x264 uncompilable on microsoft's C compiler.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
          Other notes<br />
          ---------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> You may have noted that every single library I use is statically linked.<br />
          Even the CRT is static on all projects.  Personally, I despise having any<br />
          outside DLL dependencies.  Having to install the damn visual studio<br />
          runtimes every single time you install an application is the most annoying<br />
          thing on earth.  Sure, I understand why they're used, and I know that there<br />
          are often vulnerabilities that need to be patched, but I personally go<br />
          around it by centralizing all such stuff in the utility library (see the<br />
          Utility files in OBSApi).  Generally when I get an application I like it<br />
          to work right from the start with as little setup as possible.  It's a<br />
          personal preference.</p>
        <p> If you need to allocate, use the Allocate and Free functions.  new and<br />
          delete is automatically wrapped to these as well.</p>
        <p> At some point in time I will get around to some proper documentation of<br />
          the utility library, but in the mean time, look around in the utility files<br />
      of OBSApi if you wish.</p></td>
